##Data Science and Web Development Learning Projects
#This repository contains several projects and lessons that I completed while learning various topics related to data science and web development. The projects and #lessons included in this repository are:

Data-preprocessing: A collection of Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts that showcase various data preprocessing techniques such as cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering. These notebooks cover topics such as handling missing values, dealing with outliers, and scaling data.
javascript-lesson: A set of code examples and exercises to learn the basics of JavaScript programming language, including variables, control structures, functions, and object-oriented programming.
numpy_pandas_lesson: A series of Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts that introduce the NumPy and Pandas libraries for data manipulation and analysis. The notebooks cover topics such as creating arrays, indexing and slicing data, merging and grouping data frames, and visualizing data.
python_all_lesson: A collection of Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts that cover various Python topics, including control structures, functions, classes and objects, file I/O, and regular expressions. These notebooks provide a solid foundation for anyone looking to learn Python programming.
sql_notebook_notes: A set of Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate various SQL commands and concepts, including creating and querying tables, filtering data, and performing joins and aggregates. These notebooks can serve as a starting point for learning SQL.
sql_patika_course: A collection of SQL scripts and exercises that I completed while taking an online SQL course on Patika. These scripts cover various topics such as basic SQL commands, subqueries, joins, and indexes.
Each project and lesson is contained in its own subdirectory with detailed documentation and instructions on how to run the code. Feel free to explore and learn from these projects, and please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions for improvement.
